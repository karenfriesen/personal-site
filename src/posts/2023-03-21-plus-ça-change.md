There’s nothing like a new site to make me forget all the things I wanted to write about.

I’m not a blogger, I don’t write tutorials or articles, but I’d like to be able to zap some dev thoughts up now and again without making a big production of it.

And if I ever find the recipes I had on my Personal Home Page back in the 90s, I’ll add them too.
