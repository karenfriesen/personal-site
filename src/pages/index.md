## Building in public

Starting naked, ~~clothes~~ CSS later.

Using the [Eleventy Excellent starter template](https://github.com/madrilene/eleventy-excellent) by [madrilene](https://github.com/madrilene) and going from there.

I wanted to be able to write some short posts and get them up and also tinker with the site so I’ll be working on whichever as I feel like it.
